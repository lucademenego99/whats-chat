# whats-chat

WhatsChat is a web-application built following a MVC approach, exploiting Java Servlets, JSPs and Java Beans.
It has been implemented as an exercise for the Web Architectures Master's Course, whose assignment can be found in the folder `docs/`.

The user interface has been first prepared using Figma and then recreated using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
